		My teaching philosophy states that everyone is born with musical
		ability. I believe that every person can learn to play the piano and
		express themselves through music. Music is an all encompassing field
		and I teach my students note reading, improvisation, composition,
		music history and theory. As a member of two national music teaching
		organizations, NFMC and MTNA, I stay current on teaching methods and
		have many performance opportunities available to my students.</p>
